As a user
I want to sort the polls
So that I can find the ones I want

Scenario: User selects sort method HTML
    When I select a sort method
    Then the server searches the cache
    And displays the polls the way I chose
    
Scenario: User selects sort method XML
    When I select a sort method
    Then the server searches the cache
    And displays the polls the way I chose
    
    
Scenario: User selects sort method JSON
    When I select a sort method
    Then the server searches the cache
    And displays the polls the way I chose
