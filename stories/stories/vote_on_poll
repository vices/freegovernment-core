Story: User votes on a poll

  As a user
  I want to vote on polls
  So that I may share my opinions
  
  
  Scenario: User casts first vote 
    Given I am logged in
    And it is my first vote
    When I cast my vote
    Then 1 vote should be added to my selection
    And 1 vote for every person I represent should be added to my selection
    
  Scenario: User casts first vote, HTML
    Given I am logged in
    And it is my first vote
    When I cast my vote
    Then a new poll results partial should render
    And a new poll selection partial should render
    
  Scenario: User recasts vote
    Given I am logged in
    And it is not my first vote
    When I cast my vote
    Then 1 vote should be removed from my previous selection
    And 1 vote for every person I represent should be removed from my previous selection
    And 1 vote should be added to my selection
    And 1 vote for every person I represent should be added to my selection
    
  Scenario: User recasts vote, HTML
    Given I am logged in
    And it is not my first vote
    When I cast my vote
    Then A new poll results partial should render
    And a new poll selection partial should render
